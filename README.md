###Description

This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

The rules of the game are:

    When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
    When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play
    When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
    The player who first scores 100 or more points wins.
