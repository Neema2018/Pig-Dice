# PIGDICE
#### This project is a program where a user can play a dice game online.
#### By **Precious Neema**
## Description
    This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

The rules of the game are:

   * When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
   *When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play
   *When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
